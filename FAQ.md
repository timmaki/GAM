# General Questions
## I have Google Apps Standard Edition. Can I use GAM?
No. GAM uses Google Apps APIs in order to interact with Google Apps services. Google Apps APIs are only available to Premier, Education and Partner Edition accounts (see [here](http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=60757)). Thus it is not possible to use GAM with Standard Edition domains.
